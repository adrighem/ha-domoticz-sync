# Maintainer Runs

## 2026-07-03

- Initialized maintainer state, CI, security scanning, dependency checks, Release Please, and GitHub repository setup.
- Applied the initial Dependabot GitHub Actions version updates directly on `main` after validating PR #1 contained only workflow version bumps.

## 2026-07-06

- Ran maintainer overview: no unread notifications, no open issues, one open Dependabot PR, no Dependabot alerts, and no code scanning alerts.
- Assessed `PR:4` as a low-risk GitHub Actions dependency update and prepared the equivalent local change to `actions/checkout@v7`.
- Verified locally with `python -m pytest` and `uvx ruff check .`.
- After approval, pushed `42c30d9` to `main`, closed `PR:4`, confirmed all post-push GitHub Actions passed, and rechecked that the repo inbox/issues/PRs/alerts are clean.
- Closed Release Please `PR:5` after approval because it only proposed a release for maintainer metadata, not a user-facing change.

## 2026-07-09

- Investigated failing scheduled HACS Validation run `28990549027`; the log showed an upstream GitHub raw-content rate limit while fetching `hacs.json`, followed by a false `integration_manifest` failure.
- Confirmed the same HACS container digest passed on July 8 and on the last push, so the repository manifest itself was not the cause.
- Updated the HACS workflow to use explicit read-only `contents: read` permissions, run the daily schedule at a staggered minute, and disable automated HACS comments.
