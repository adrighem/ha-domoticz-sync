# Maintainer Runs

## 2026-07-03

- Initialized maintainer state, CI, security scanning, dependency checks, Release Please, and GitHub repository setup.
- Applied the initial Dependabot GitHub Actions version updates directly on `main` after validating PR #1 contained only workflow version bumps.

## 2026-07-06

- Ran maintainer overview: no unread notifications, no open issues, one open Dependabot PR, no Dependabot alerts, and no code scanning alerts.
- Assessed `PR:4` as a low-risk GitHub Actions dependency update and prepared the equivalent local change to `actions/checkout@v7`.
- Verified locally with `python -m pytest` and `uvx ruff check .`.
- After approval, pushed `42c30d9` to `main`, closed `PR:4`, confirmed all post-push GitHub Actions passed, and rechecked that the repo inbox/issues/PRs/alerts are clean.
- Closed Release Please `PR:5` after approval because it only proposed a release for maintainer metadata, not a user-facing change.

## 2026-07-09

- Investigated failing scheduled HACS Validation run `28990549027`; the log showed an upstream GitHub raw-content rate limit while fetching `hacs.json`, followed by a false `integration_manifest` failure.
- Confirmed the same HACS container digest passed on July 8 and on the last push, so the repository manifest itself was not the cause.
- Updated the HACS workflow to use explicit read-only `contents: read` permissions, run the daily schedule at a staggered minute, and disable automated HACS comments.

## 2026-07-25

- Ran maintainer overview: no unread notifications, no open issues, two open PRs (PR #7, PR #8), no Dependabot alerts, and no code scanning alerts.
- Assessed `PR:8` as a low-risk GitHub Actions dependency update and prepared the equivalent local change to `actions/setup-python@v7`.
- Verified locally with `python -m pytest` and `uvx ruff check .`.
- After approval, pushed `9aee2bee8ef5a07b44927c30d38f968f192306b9` to `main`, closed `PR:8`, confirmed all post-push GitHub Actions passed, and rechecked that the repo inbox/issues/PRs/alerts are clean.
- Closed Release Please `PR:7` after approval because it only proposed a release for maintainer metadata and CI adjustments, not a user-facing change.

## 2026-08-07

- Ran maintainer overview: no unread notifications, no open issues, one open Dependabot PR (`PR:30`), no Dependabot alerts, and no code scanning alerts.
- Found that `PR:30` pinned a superseded Home Assistant 2026.8 beta test package and failed because the new `radon` sensor device class lacked an explicit export decision.
- Applied the stable `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component==0.13.354` update directly, documented `radon` as a Custom Sensor, and added forward-compatible policy coverage.
- Verified 738 current-Home-Assistant tests, 182 minimum-Home-Assistant tests, 526 neutral-core Python 3.9 tests, Ruff, compilation, and diff checks.
- After approval, pushed `244e2879cdfdd001f06156b3ee6e5e26335158dc` to `main`; all GitHub workflows passed, Dependabot auto-closed `PR:30`, and the final inbox/issues/PRs/alerts overview was clean.

## 2026-08-31

- Ran maintainer overview: no unread notifications, no open issues, one open Dependabot PR (`PR:33`), no Dependabot alerts, and no code scanning alerts.
- Assessed `PR:33` as a low-risk python package dependency update and prepared the equivalent local change to `pyproject.toml`.
- Verified locally with `.venv/bin/pytest` (738 passed) and `.venv/bin/ruff check .` (passed).
- After approval, commit and push changes to `main`, close `PR:33` with a public note, and verify inbox/issues/PRs/alerts overview is clean.

## 2026-09-11

- Ran maintainer overview: no unread notifications, no open issues, one open Dependabot PR (`PR:34`), no Dependabot alerts, and no code scanning alerts.
- Assessed `PR:34` as a low-risk python test dependency update (`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` to 0.13.363) tracking Home Assistant 2026.9.0.
- Verified locally with `.venv/bin/pytest` (738 passed) and `.venv/bin/ruff check .` (passed).
- After approval, committed and pushed changes to `main` (refs #34), closed `PR:34`, and verified inbox/issues/PRs/alerts overview is clean.
